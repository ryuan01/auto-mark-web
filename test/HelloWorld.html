<p>Welcome to the <em>best web</em> page on the internet, created by  <strong>Thanos Kaloudis</strong>! The purpose of this web page is to introduce myself and get practice with HTML.</p>

<p>We use HTML for the content of the web page, as well as structural information about that content. We do <em>not</em> use HTML to specify how the content will look in the page; that's what CSS is for, and we'll talk about that next week</p>
